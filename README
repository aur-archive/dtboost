Notes specific to ArchLinux

(read also Readme in source tarbal - you can find it in src/ directory....)


Please note, that you have to edit configuration file /etc/dtboost.conf  
to list critical applications you want to reprioritize, and few other things.

After installation try to run the script manually to watch what it prints out:
$/usr/local/dtboost/dtboost.py
that way it will run in verbose mode. Init script starts it in quiet mode.

you can see some logs in /var/log/user.log (only if run in quit mode - 'dtboost.py -q'), try:
$grep dtboost /var/log/user.log
